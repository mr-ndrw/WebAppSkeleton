# WebAppSkeleton
The most generic web app skeleton. Comes with package.json and gulpfile.js and index.html file already set up for quick out-of-box development.

Just make sure that you have gulp up and running. 
Once you've got that, go to the project root and execute:
```npm install ```
This should install any /node_modules development dependencies.

Now just fire the: ```gulp``` command and watch the magic happen. Everything is nicely built and hinted.

Express server runs on port 4000 and livereload on 4002, so either make sure you've got nothing hooked to this ports or just change them inside the gulpfile.js :)
